This software is a computer program whose purpose is to simulate the
motion of interacting Brownian particles in a quasi-1d environment,
some of them being driven by an external force.

with loading,  using,  modifying and/or developing or reproducing the
software by the user in light of its specific status of free software,
that may mean  that it is complicated to manipulate,  and  that  also
therefore means  that it is reserved for developers  and  experienced
professionals having in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore
