This software is a computer program whose purpose is to simulate the
motion of interacting Brownian particles in a quasi-1d environment,
some of them being driven by an external force.

This software is governed by the CeCILL license under French law and
abiding by the rules of distribution of free software.  You can  use,

liability.

In this respect, the user's attention is drawn to the risks associated
with loading,  using,  modifying and/or developing or reproducing the
software by the user in light of its specific status of free software,
that may mean  that it is complicated to manipulate,  and  that  also
therefore means  that it is reserved for developers  and  experienced
professionals having in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore
encouraged to load and test the software's suitability as regards their
requirements in conditions enabling the security of their systems and/or
data to be ensured and,  more generally, to use and operate it in the
same conditions as regards security.
